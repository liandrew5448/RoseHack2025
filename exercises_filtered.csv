Tip: The easiest way to do this is to have someone hand you the bar as you lay down.', 'With your arms extended, position the bar over your torso. Your arms and your torso should create a 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.', 'Lower the bar by bending at the elbow while keeping the upper arms stationary and elbows in. Go down until the bar lightly touches your forehead. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.', 'Flex the triceps as you lift the bar back to its starting position. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement.', 'Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.']"

You should be standing directly in front of the weight stack.', 'Now pull the handle down so that your upper arm and elbow are locked in to the side of your body. Your upper arm and forearm should form an acute angle (less than 90-degrees). You can keep the other arm by the waist and you can have one leg in front of you and the other one back for better balance. This will be your starting position.', 'As you contract the triceps, move the single handle attachment down to your side until your arm is straight. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Your upper arms should remain stationary at all times.', 'Squeeze the triceps and hold for a second in this contracted position.', 'Slowly return the handle to the starting position.', 'Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the other arm.']"
